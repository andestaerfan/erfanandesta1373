Hi, I'm Erfan Andesta, a Senior iOS Engineer with a passion for creating exceptional user experiences. I've been an active member of the development community since 2017, working on various projects worldwide.

My programming journey began at the age of 18 with Java, where I implemented student projects. As I gained more experience, I ventured into web application development as a freelancer, using NodeJS and AngularJS. It was during this time that I purchased a MacBook Air, which deepened my appreciation for Apple products.

Motivated by my newfound love for Apple, I downloaded Xcode and delved into Swift. Over the past 6 years, I have been dedicated to crafting highly testable Swift code for different companies. Collaborating with over 15 iOS developers across 10 different projects, my goal is always to deliver the best user experience possible.

With a strong focus on native iOS development, I am proficient in using Xcode as my primary tool. I specialize in working with UI components such as Storyboards, Xibs, Sizing classes, Auto layouts, IBDesignables, and more. By handling these components effectively, I minimize the need for extensive UI customization in the code. Additionally, I have adopted a code-based approach to developing views, ensuring better performance and faster development.

Beyond my technical skills, I pride myself on my ability to work collaboratively with product owners, designers, and fellow developers. By deeply understanding a product's requirements and specifications, I consistently produce work with minimal errors and within the desired timeframe.

Technology has always fascinated me, and I'm constantly excited about its potential. Outside of work, I enjoy indulging in hobbies such as video games, reading novels, and playing ping pong.

Let's connect and create amazing experiences together!

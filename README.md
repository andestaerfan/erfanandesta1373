Hi I'm Erfan Andesta 👨🏼‍💻

I'm an Senior iOS Engineer 💻 and I have been in this community since 2017 experincing difference projects across the worlds.

I have started programming when I was 18 with Java, implementing some student-projects.
After some experience with Java I started using NodeJS and AngularJS to implement web applications as a freelancer. 
At that time I bought a Macbook air 🥳 and founded how much I love apple products 🍏.


I downloaded Xcode and started exploring Swift. Now it's been over 4 years that I'm developing highly testable swift code for different companies.
I have worked with more that 15 iOS developer all across the world over 10 different projects.
My goal is to provide the best user experience for my users, providing fast, optimized, responsive state-of-art pixel-perfect implementation, yet using what’s best on iOS development.
I have experience working on native iOS applications using Xcode as a primary tool.
One of my specialties is working with UI components, including Storyboards, Xibs, Sizing classes, Auto layouts, IBDesignables, and so on.
That if handled correctly, very little UI customization is required in the code. Also, I have been developing views in code for better performance and faster development.
Apart from technical skills, I value my ability to work collaboratively with product owners, designers, and developers to gain a deep understanding of a product’s requirements and specifications which leads to work being produced with minimal errors in a timely manner. 
I am passionate about technology and what it can do for us. Personally, some of my hobbies are video games, reading novels, and ping pong.
